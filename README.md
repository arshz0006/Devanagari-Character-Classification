## Devnagri Character Recognition Model

After getting acquainted with CNN models and having the knowledge of MNSIT dataset, I was quivering to do something similar with Hindi language. 
I found out Devnagri character recognition dataset on kaggle and started working on it.

To better understand the functioning of CNN models, I implemented the model myself without using transfer learning method.

**After training the model for 100 epoch, my model had accuracy score of 99.69% on validation dataset. **
